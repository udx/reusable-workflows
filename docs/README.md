# Documentation

Reusable workflow documentation and setup guides live in `docs/workflows/`.

## Workflow Docs

- `docs/workflows/docker-ops.md`
- `docs/workflows/npm-release-ops.md`
- `docs/workflows/wp-gh-release-ops.md`

## Keyless Publishing

Prefer keyless (OIDC) publishing wherever supported. Use tokens only when required (for example, installing private dependencies or when the registry does not support OIDC).
